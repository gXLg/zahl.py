# zahl.py
Python script to write out numbers in German

The script was written to be as short
as possible, while keeping the ability
to write any possible integer as a word
in German langauge

For reference on the naming system
check out the German Wikipedia page
[Zahlennamen](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahlennamen)

The script was developed on Discord
with the help of these amazing people:
* @blueberrypi (my coc server and DMs)
* @krowten024nabru (official python server)

# History

* The idea for this program was created
  around September 2022 in the "World of
  Coding" Discord server during a
  conversation about German language
* Around the same time private Clash of Code
  events have been popular on the server and
  blueberrypi and I who were battling
  equally for the top of the leaderboard
  came up with the idea of creatingn an
  own code golf challenge
* The initial program has been written
  around a week later and was 2662 bytes
* Original goal was to be able to send the
  code as a single discors message
* First big clean-up happened in
  October 2022 and the program was brought down
  to 1656 bytes
* Since it went down so quicky, our next goal
  was to bring it under 1k
* At the end of December 2022: 1337 bytes
* After creating my own CoC server,
  the golfing discussion went on there
  with various tips from different
  community members
* We hit the bottom in May 2023 at around
  1050 bytes. I joined the official Python
  community and inquired some help, but only
  one guy, krowten024nabru, could help
  and brought the code down by 1 byte
* August 24th 2023 final 5 bytes have been
  cut off and the code size is 999 bytes.
  With that our goal was achieved and we
  finished working on it any further
* In June 2024 I came back to the project
  and was able to cut down 5 more bytes
