# zahl.py
Python script to write out numbers in German

The script was written to be as short
as possible, while keeping the ability
to write any possible integer as a word
in German langauge

For reference on the naming system
check out the German Wikipedia page
[Zahlennamen](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahlennamen)

The script was developed on discord
with the help of these amazing people:
* @blueberrypi (my coc server and DMs)
* @krowten024nabru (official python server)
